# Objectives

Why would we like to simulate capture data : 

1) Estimate the effects of biological process on estimated abundance and juvenile abundance in a sampled population.
2) Estimates the effects of study design changes on estimated abundance and juvenile abundance in a sampled population.
3) Define best conditions to use sigmoid method
