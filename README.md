# How reliable is the estimated phenology ? 
# 

## Introduction

We developped a method, based on the study of the productivity (proportion of juveniles among all caught individuals), which allow the estimation of : 
- the breeding timing (xmid parameter, proxy for phenology)
- the breeding success (asymptote parameter, final proportion of juvenile in the sampled population)
- the variance in breeding phenology (scale parameter

The aim of this project is to investigate how well estimated is the phenology (using sigmoid bayesian approach) when parameters associated with the phenology (mean and variance of laying dates, survival, breeding success...) vary. For this, we want to simulate breeding phenology of a (bird) population


## 1 - Estimate phenology without taking into account young dispersal 

In a study area, corresponding to the "sample area" of a capture site. 

## 2 - Including young dispersal
